<h1>The Rules</h1>
<p>The game works much like regular tic-tac-toe. You and your opponent take turns making and X or an O somewhere on the board. Your move determines which minor board your opponent is allowed to move in on their next turn. The goal is to win the large board, which is done by winning the smaller boards. Diagrams to come.</p>
